    "> The notion of Smart City has evolved from being technology centric to more citizen centric. That means, our perception on the places has changed and evolved from the traditional notion of smart infrastructure to the like of ‘Livable City” ,”Happy City” or “Green City” instead. While City infrastructure will always be one of the indicator for city posture, in the end, Citizen requirement has to be significantly measured.  This reports aims to provide a framework for measuring and comparing scores between neighborhoods for to assist stakeholders in making strategic decision or action.One could not improve on what one could not measure. To date, city governors are adopting different metric for measuring city performance.\n",
    ">This report will be based on features that in our opinion representing some basic parameters to measure score of city performance. These features are discussed in greater detail in the Data section.\n",

As such, the ability to measure how a city or community is progressing as compared to others will be handful. Managing cities and their community are complex job and thus requires integrated approach that measures various aspects. On the other hand, with the advent of digitalization, infrastructure operation and citizen activities can now generate more data in real time that can be useful, which can contribute towards new insights and knowledge.\n",

In the lights of outbreak such as COVID-19 for example, information are sought  (by the public) at a rate higher than ever as people need to know how their city/neighborhood is coping with the situation. This project aims to conduct a comparative study on neighborhoods within a selected city (New York) based on integrated location data and demography.  While doing so, we believed that analytical framework  developed for this study would be applicable to other cities or further developed into a proper data product.\n",

However, before any implementation or commencement of study, a good understanding of business case is crucial to ensure we will engage and acquire the right set of data and information. This is to eliminate ‘garbage in garbage out’ issue at the later stage. While there are many methods of measuring city performance and benchmarking existed, our approach aims to strike balance in the way we evaluate our city/neighborhood. As such we believed that the life elements such as health, social, economy and some demographic aspect would be worth experimenting or studied, especially when comparing places for living or work.
